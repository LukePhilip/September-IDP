Over the course of this project, I have truly been introduced to the world of coding. I decided to completely change my IDP to show how far I have come as a programmer thus far in the year. Throughout this project I have used skills like, variables, functions, conditionals and arrays. By making this canvas drawing app, I believe that I fully demonstrated my knowledge thus far in the course. I utilized variables(let) to define certain things to refer back to them in later functions. I used functions to create the Canvas and to create a program that draws out the pen strokes. I particularly used arrays to create my eraseCanvas button. Finally, I used a conditional to say: if the mouse is clicked on the canvas, then draw the line.
